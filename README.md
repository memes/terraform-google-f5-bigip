This repo contains unofficial and unsupported<sup>1</sup> Terraform modules to
deploy F5 BIG-IP Virtual Edition on Google Cloud Platform, using a modular
approach that can be composed into a solution that is consistent for each variant
of a product.

These modules support deploying supported BIG-IP versions instances to Google
Cloud in an opinionated manner. By themselves they do not implement a full stack
or solution, and additional setup will be needed for firewall rules, service
account creation and role assignments.

> **NOTE:** The modules do not include setup and configuration of supporting
> resources, such as ingress firewall rules or service accounts. Where required,
> the examples will include the bare-minimum setup to demonstrate usage.

Examples are provided for standalone, HA and CFE deployments.

## Rationale

The intent is allow for integration of BIG-IP with GCP infrastructure that is
managed using Google's
[Cloud Foundation Toolkit](https://cloud.google.com/foundation-toolkit)
Terraform modules or an equivalent. The modules here are not fully-baked
solutions, but can be integrated with foundational elements to build a reusable
deployment pipeline.

For example, the modules do not include ingress firewall rule resources as core
module components. This is because some organizations may mandate use of service
account based rules, where others prefer tag based, or a combination of both where
interfaces are attached to peered VPCs. The exception to this is the firewall
module to support ConfigSync for HA and CFE clusters; since the BIG-IPs will be
deployed to the same VPC networks, it is reasonably safe to assume a service
account based rule will be universally applicable.

## BIG-IP module options

The BIG-IP module will create standalone BIG-IP VMs that include default
[AS3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/)
and [DO](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/)
declarations (unless overridden). The sub-modules extend the standalone
functionality while retaining an the same API (implemented as Terraform input
variables) where possible. This promotes consistency and reuse when your project
calls for a CFE or Autoscaling approach. For more information about these see
the README files in each sub-module.

<!-- spell-checker: ignore configsync  -->
* Standalone BIG-IP instances
  * Support 1-8 network interfaces
  * Opinionated startup scripts
  * Override default gateway when needed; e.g. for bootstrapping in a restricted
     VPC where data-plane does not have egress
  * [Applications Services 3](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension/latest/) extension support
  * [Declarative Onboarding](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-declarative-onboarding/latest/) extension support
* High-availability BIG-IP clusters
  * **configsync-fw** helper sub-module to create required firewall rules for ConfigSync on control and data-plane networks
  * [Cloud Failover Extension](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-cloud-failover/latest/) support
  * **cfe-role** helper sub-module to create a custom role which satisfies the
    minimum privileges required for CFE to interact with GCP APIs

## Dependencies

The BIG-IP modules all have a common set of requirements.

1. Terraform 0.12

   > You are viewing a **1.x release** of the modules, which supports
   > **Terraform 0.12** only. *For modules compatible with Terraform 0.13, use a
   > 2.x release.* Functionality is identical, but separate releases are required
   > due to the difference in *variable validation* between Terraform 0.12 and 0.13.

2. Google Cloud [Secret Manager](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager)

   There are many good options for run-time secret injection but this module is
   supporting Google's Secret Manager only at this time.

3. APIs to enable

   * Compute Engine `compute.googleapis.com`
   <!-- spell-checker: ignore secretmanager  -->
   * Secret Manager `secretmanager.googleapis.com`
   * Storage (required for CFE) `storage-api.googleapis.com`

## Run-time setup

The BIG-IP modules in this repo support [cloud-init](https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and [metadata-startup-script](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/startupscript)
boot options, defaulting to the metadata startup-script for compatibility with
BIG-IP versions 13.x, 14.x, and 15.x. Set the `use_cloud_init` input variable to
`true` to force the use of cloud-init on BIG-IP v15+.

Fundamentally both approaches launch the same shell scripts; the difference is
that `cloud-init` script installs a systemd service unit with dependencies to
prevent early execution, and automatically disables the service unit after
success. The simple metadata startup-script will execute on every boot.

For more information on how run-time configuration is applied to each BIG-IP
instance through the use of Terraform variables see
[CONFIGURATION](https://github.com/memes/terraform-google-f5-bigip/blob/main/CONFIGURATION.md).

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| admin\_password\_secret\_manager\_key | The Secret Manager key for BIG-IP admin password; during initialisation, the<br>BIG-IP admin account's password will be changed to the value retrieved from GCP<br>Secret Manager using this key.<br><br>NOTE: if the secret does not exist, is misidentified, or if the VM cannot read<br>the secret value associated with this key, then the BIG-IP onboarding will fail<br>to complete, and onboarding will require manual intervention. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| allow\_phone\_home | Allow the BIG-IP VMs to send high-level device use information to help F5<br>optimize development resources. If set to false the information is not sent. | `bool` | `true` | no |

| automatic\_restart | Determines if the BIG-IP VMs should be automatically restarted if terminated by<br>GCE. Defaults to true to match expected GCE behaviour. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| custom\_script | An optional, custom shell script that will be executed during BIG-IP<br>initialisation, after BIG-IP networking is auto-configured, admin password is set from Secret<br>Manager (if possible), etc. Declarative Onboarding offers a better approach,<br>where suitable (see `do_payload`).<br><br>NOTE: this value should contain the script contents, not a file path. | `string` | `""` | no |
| default\_gateway | Set this to the value to use as the default gateway for BIG-IP instances. This<br>could be an IP address or environment variable to use at run-time. If left blank,<br>the onboarding script will use the gateway for nic0.<br><br>Default value is '$EXT\_GATEWAY' which will match the run-time upstream gateway<br>for nic0.<br><br>NOTE: this string will be inserted into the boot script as-is; it can be an IPv4<br>address, or a shell variable that is known to exist during network configuration<br>script execution. | `string` | `"$EXT_GATEWAY"` | no |
| delete\_disk\_on\_destroy | Set this flag to false if you want the boot disk associated with the launched VMs<br>to survive when instances are destroyed. The default value of true will ensure the<br>boot disk is destroyed when the instance is destroyed. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| description | An optional description that will be applied to the instances. Default value is<br>an empty string, which will be replaced by a generated description at run-time. | `string` | `""` | no |

| do\_payloads | The Declarative Onboarding contents to apply to the instances. Required. This<br>module has migrated to use of Declarative Onboarding for module activation,<br>licensing, NTP, DNS, and other basic configurations. Sample payloads are in the<br>examples folder.<br><br>Note: if left empty, the module will use a simple JSON that sets NTP and DNS,<br>and enables LTM. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| domain\_name | An optional domain name to append to generated instance names to fully-qualify<br>them. If an empty string (default), then the instances will be qualified as-per<br>Google Cloud internal naming conventions ".ZONE.c.PROJECT\_ID.internal". | `string` | `""` | no |
| enable\_os\_login | Set to true to enable OS Login on the VMs. Default value is false as BIG-IP does<br>not support in OS Login mode currently.<br>NOTE: this value will override an 'enable-oslogin' key in `metadata` map. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| enable\_serial\_console | Set to true to enable serial port console on the VMs. Default value is false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
