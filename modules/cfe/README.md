# BIG-IP cluster with Cloud Failover extension

> You are viewing a **1.x release** of the modules, which supports
> **Terraform 0.12** only. *For modules compatible with Terraform 0.13, use a
> 2.x release.* Functionality is identical, but separate releases are required
> due to the difference in *variable validation* between Terraform 0.12 and 0.13.

This module encapsulates the creation of BIG-IP HA cluster with [Cloud Failover
Extension](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-cloud-failover/latest/)
to manage run-time update of GCP resources (routes, alias IPs, etc.) on failover
events.

> **NOTE:** This module is unsupported and not an official F5 product. If you
> require assistance please join our
> [Slack GCP channel](https://f5cloudsolutions.slack.com/messages/gcp) and ask!

## Example

This will create a pair of BIG-IP instances with CFE configured to manage GCP
resources that have the label `f5_cloud_failover_label` populated with value
`cfe-example`. Explicit IP addresses are provided in lieu of valid DNS.

> **NOTE:** As with other BIG-IP modules in this repo, the Admin user password
> must be stored in Secret Manager with read-only access granted to the service
> account.

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| admin\_password\_secret\_manager\_key | The Secret Manager key for BIG-IP admin password; during initialisation, the<br>BIG-IP admin account's password will be changed to the value retrieved from GCP<br>Secret Manager using this key.<br><br>NOTE: if the secret does not exist, is misidentified, or if the VM cannot read<br>the secret value associated with this key, then the BIG-IP onboarding will fail<br>to complete, and onboarding will require manual intervention. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| allow\_phone\_home | Allow the BIG-IP VMs to send high-level device use information to help F5<br>optimize development resources. If set to false the information is not sent. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| allow\_usage\_analytics | Allow the BIG-IP VMs to send anonymous statistics to F5 to help us determine how<br>to improve our solutions (default). If set to false no statistics will be sent. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| as3\_payloads | An optional, but recommended, list of AS3 JSON files that can be used to setup<br>the BIG-IP instances. If left empty (default), the module will use a simple<br>no-op AS3 declaration. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| automatic\_restart | Determines if the BIG-IP VMs should be automatically restarted if terminated by<br>GCE. Defaults to true to match expected GCE behaviour. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| cfe\_label\_key | The CFE label key to assign to resources that are going to be managed by CFE.<br>Default value is 'f5\_cloud\_failover\_label'. | `string` | `"f5_cloud_failover_label"` | no |
| cfe\_label\_value | The CFE label value to assign to resources that are going to be managed by this<br>BIG-IP deployment. This value must uniquely identify a resource set and is a<br>required configuration value. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| cfe\_payload | The CFE payload contents to apply to the instances; default is an empty string.<br><br>Note: if left empty, the module will use a simple JSON that sets the CFE scoping<br>label pair on storage, and failover addresses, but nothing more. You will need to<br>override and provide the correct CFE payload for your environment. | `string` | `""` | no |
| default\_gateway | Set this to the value to use as the default gateway for BIG-IP instances. This<br>could be an IP address or environment variable to use at run-time. If left blank,<br>the onboarding script will use the gateway for nic0.<br><br>Default value is '$EXT\_GATEWAY' which will match the run-time upstream gateway<br>for nic0.<br><br>NOTE: this string will be inserted into the boot script as-is; it can be an IPv4<br>address, or a shell variable that is known to exist during network configuration<br>script execution. | `string` | `"$EXT_GATEWAY"` | no |
| delete\_disk\_on\_destroy | Set this flag to false if you want the boot disk associated with the launched VMs<br>to survive when instances are destroyed. The default value of true will ensure the<br>boot disk is destroyed when the instance is destroyed. | `bool` | `true` | no |
| description | An optional description that will be applied to the instances. Default value is<br>an empty string, which will be replaced by a generated description at run-time. | `string` | `""` | no |
| disk\_size\_gb | Use this flag to set the boot volume size in GB. If left at the default value<br>the boot disk will have the same size as specified in 'bigip\_image'. | `number` | `null` | no |
| disk\_type | The boot disk type to use with instances; can be 'pd-ssd' (default), or<br>'pd-standard'.<br>\*Note:\* Choosing 'pd-standard' will reduce operating cost, but at the expense of<br>network performance. | `string` | `"pd-ssd"` | no |
| dns\_servers | An optional list of DNS servers for BIG-IP instances to use, if explicit DO files<br>are not provided. The default is ["169.254.169.254"] to use GCE metadata server. | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br>  "169.254.169.254"<br>]</pre> | no |
| do\_payloads | The Declarative Onboarding contents to apply to the instances. This<br>module has migrated to use of Declarative Onboarding for module activation,<br>licensing, NTP, DNS, and other<br>basic configurations. Sample payloads are in the examples folder.<br><br>Note: if left empty, the module will use a simple JSON that sets NTP and DNS,<br>and enables LTM module, and configures a sync-group with active-standby failover<br>among the instances. | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| domain\_name | An optional domain name to append to generated instance names to fully-qualify<br>them. If an empty string (default), then the instances will be qualified as-per<br>Google Cloud internal naming conventions ".ZONE.c.PROJECT\_ID.internal". | `string` | `""` | no |
| enable\_os\_login | Set to true to enable OS Login on the VMs. Default value is false as BIG-IP does<br>not support in OS Login mode currently.<br>NOTE: this value will override an 'enable-oslogin' key in `metadata` map. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| enable\_serial\_console | Set to true to enable serial port console on the VMs. Default value is false. | `bool` | `false` | no |
| external\_subnetwork | The fully-qualified self-link of the subnet that will be used for external ingress<br>(2+ NIC deployment), or for all traffic in a 1NIC deployment. | `string` | n/a | yes |

| install\_cloud\_libs | An optional list of cloud library URLs that will be downloaded and installed on<br>the BIG-IP VM during initial boot. The contents of each download will be compared<br>to the verifyHash file, and failure will cause the boot scripts to fail.

| instance\_name\_template | A format string that will be used when naming instance, that should include a<br>format token for including integer ordinal numbers as defined in Go `fmt` package,<br>including support for zero-padding etc. Default value is 'bigip-%d' which will<br>generate names of 'bigip-0', 'bigip-1', through 'bigip-N', where N is the number<br>of instances - 1.<br><br>Examples:<br>instance\_name\_template = "bigip-%03d" will create instances named 'bigip-000',<br>'bigip-001', etc.<br>instance\_name\_template = "prod-ha-%x" will create instances using lower-case hex<br>, such as 'prod-ha-0' ... 'prod-ha-1f'.<br><br>See `instance_ordinal_offset` variable to change the lower bounds of the numbering<br>scheme. | `string` | `"bigip-%d"` | no |
