# Cloud Failover Extension sub-module using with 3-NICs, fully-qualified hostnames, to multiple availability zones

> You are viewing a **2.x release** of the modules, which supports
> **Terraform 0.13** only. *For modules compatible with Terraform 0.12, use a
> 1.x release.* Functionality is identical, but separate releases are required
> due to the difference in *variable validation* between Terraform 0.12 and 0.13.

This example demonstrates how to use the
[CFE sub-module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/memes/f5-bigip/google/latest/submodules/cfe)
to deploy a pair of BIG-IP instances in a 3-NIC configuration, with
[Cloud Failover Extension](https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-cloud-failover/latest/)
installed and configured. Each BIG-IP will have a fully-qualified hostname and be
deployed to different availability zones.

> **NOTE:** This example does not include firewall rules, ingress routes, or any
> other dependencies needed to for a fully-functional deployment. The intent is
> only to demonstrate how to *add* a CFE-based BIG-IP component to a broader
> deployment.

## Example tfvars file

* Deploy to project: `my-project-id`
* Deploy BIG-IPs to zones: `us-west1-a`, and `us-west1-b`
* Assign BIG-IP data-plane (external) to VPC: `external` in `us-west1` subnet `ext-west`
* Assign BIG-IP control-plane to VPC: `management` in `us-west1` subnet `mgmt-west`
* Assign BIG-IP data-plane (internal) to VPC: `internal` in `us-west1` subnet `int-west`
* BIG-IP will use service account: `bigip@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
* BIG-IP admin user password is stored in Secret Manager under the key:
  `bigip-admin-password-key`
* BIG-IPs will have names like `cfe-NN.example.com`

### Prerequisites

* VPC networks for `external`, `management`, and `internal` with subnets in
  region where the BIG-IPs will be deployed
* Service account to be used by BIG-IP VMs
* BIG-IP admin account password stored in Secret Manager, with `read` access
  granted to BIG-IP service account

### Resources created

<!-- spell-checker: ignore payg -->
* 2x VMs running BIG-IP v15.1 PAYG license
  * `ha-bigip-00.example.com` in `us-west1-a`
  * `ha-bigip-01.example.com` in `us-west1-b`
* 3 reserved internal IP addresses on `external` VPC network
  * 2 addresses will be assigned to BIG-IP instances on external interface
  * 1 will be used for a VIP that will be assigned to the active BIG-IP as an
    alias IP
* 2 reserved internal IP addresses on `management` VPC network; these will be
  assigned to management interface on BIG-IP instances
* 2 reserved internal IP addresses on `internal` VPC network; these will be
  assigned to internal interface on BIG-IP instances
* Custom CFE IAM role created and assigned to BIG-IP service account
* Cloud Storage bucket for CFE shared state; BIG-IP service account will be
  granted read-write access to bucket
* Firewall rules to permit BIG-IP ConfigSync traffic on `management` and
  `internal` VPC networks, limited to VMs using BIG-IP service account

### External modules used in example

* Google [Cloud Storage](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/terraform-google-modules/cloud-storage/google/1.7.2)
