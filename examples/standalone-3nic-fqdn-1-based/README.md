# Standalone BIG-IP (3-NIC) with one-based FQDN

> You are viewing a **2.x release** of the modules, which supports
> **Terraform 0.13** only. *For modules compatible with Terraform 0.12, use a
> 1.x release.* Functionality is identical, but separate releases are required
> due to the difference in *variable validation* between Terraform 0.12 and 0.13.

This example demonstrates how to use the
[BIG-IP module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/memes/f5-bigip/google/latest)
to deploy a single BIG-IP instance in a 3-NIC configuration.

> **NOTE:** This example does not include firewall rules, ingress routes, or any
> other dependencies needed to for a fully-functional deployment. The intent is
> only to demonstrate how to *add* a single BIG-IP component to a broader
> deployment.

## Example tfvars file

* Deploy to project: `my-project-id`
* Deploy BIG-IP to zone: `us-west1-c`
* Assign BIG-IP data-plane (external) to VPC: `us-west1` subnet `ext-west`
* Assign BIG-IP control-plane to VPC: `us-west1` subnet `mgmt-west`
* Assign BIG-IP data-plane (internal) to VPC: `us-west1` subnet `int-west`
* BIG-IP will use service account: `bigip@my-project-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
* BIG-IP admin user password is stored in Secret Manager under the key:
  `bigip-admin-password-key`
* BIG-IP will be named: `dev-001.example.com`
